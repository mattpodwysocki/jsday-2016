# Building Reactive Architectures - jsDay 2016

## Abstract

In the past few years, we’ve seen many approaches to the MV* architectures from Backbone, knockout, Angular, and many other frameworks that came and went in between times. Some of these frameworks suffered from performance issues with two way data binding, data loading and so forth. Along came React, getting rid of the two way data binding, and bringing a new way of thinking of how we design web apps. Let’s take some of those lessons, with immutability, unidirectional data flow, and reactive programming to create new architectures such as those seen in Cycle.js, Yolk.js and even React with RxJS and let your mind run free on these new ideas.
